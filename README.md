# Customizable Adventure Game v1.2
Created by:Anthony DePaul
Music by: Jordan Friedland

A customizable adventure game! Make sure the game_resources folder is in the same folder as the AdventureGame.jar. Run AdevntureGame.jar to play. All the images can be changed within the game_resources folder to make your own game. There are other README files if you need help (be sure to read the README.html files unless you're viewing this from GitHub).

Starting from v1.2, there are two types of downloads: play and edit. Like the names suggest, if you just plan on playing the game download the play version so that the download is smaller. If you plan on editing the game resources, the edit version contains the READMEs and photoshop documents to help you with that. Both though can be used to run and customize the game.
