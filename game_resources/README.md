# Game Resources

Each folder (entities, menus, sounds and zones) has a README.html file in it already that explains how to edit those specific resources. Here are a few things to note beforehand:

- Many of the images use a grid where one square is always 32 x 32px.
- Most images have a photoshop document to be used as a template/guide. In order for the game to use the image, be sure to save your final version as a PNG (or GIF for animation).
- The only images you can change the size of are the entity animations and zone images.
- PNGs support transparency/translucency so you can make fancy shadows or something.
