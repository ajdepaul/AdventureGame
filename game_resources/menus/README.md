# Menus
These images aren't too complicated. These images are used for the buttons and backgrounds in different menus of the game.

------------
### Backgrounds
All menus (*excluding the main menu*) can have transparent backgrounds. The pause menu also contains the players inventory. To make sure the items get lined up with the background, use the background that is already there as a template.

------------
### Buttons
For the buttons there are three different states.
- Top: normal button
- Middle: mouse hovered over button
- Bottom: button clicked

If you don't feel like making different buttons states that's okay. Just make sure they're all the same.
